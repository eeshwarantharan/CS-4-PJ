T:
- Here's my idea to create an app as a part of our project. It shld be practically feasible.
  We create an app for our clg, i.e for all students, phd scholars and faculties included. 
  App shld be able to manage;
  1. Login for fac, studs, phds
  2. TT management - CR's can edit it if needed
  3. Chat feature - both priv and grp 
  4. (Main - suggest ur ideas aswell) In order to draw ppl to use our app, i thought maybe we can use the social relations b/w ppl as the crux.
      They make profiles, add their interests and stuff. We assign "PULL" count for each of them. At start it's 0.
      After makin profile, ppl can draft out their own unique puzzle or task based on their interest's using GPT.
      If a person's PULL gets incremented as he completes the tasks set by other ppl. A leaderboard will show who in clg, has matched interests
      with most accd to PULL. 
  5. We can also add a feature for studs to raise doubts to faculties...
  6. UI shld be neat and clean (Figma shld be used)
